## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/project-outline/)

### Overview

A simple web application that checks music taste compatibility between two spotify users.

Inspiration from this project comes from my own experience making friends. I've noticed that some of my best friendships have come out of a shared interest in similar music, and an ability to introduce one another to new music. The social nature of Spotify and their fantastic Web API make Spotify a clear choice for gathering user information.

### Features

- Ability to see your own listening trends (Top Artists, Top Songs, Top Genres, Top Playlists)
- Ability to see how well your music tastes match with your friends'
  - See what artists you have in common
  - See what new artists your friend can introduce you to (use shared genres)
  - 

### Technologies

- Spotify Web API
- React front end (`create-react-app`)
- Node backend (works well with the Spotify Web API, I'm told) _Note: We are sacrificing ease of implementation here. Node is notorious for set-up time_
- Github Pages, to host the project
- Webpack for deploys???

### What I'll Have to Learn

- Working with the Spotify Web API
- Deploys with Webpack/Jenkins
- Creating a react app from scratch!
